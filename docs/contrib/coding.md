# Coding conventions

* two spaces, no tabs
* no trailing whitespaces, blank lines should have no spaces
* Do not mix multiple fixes into a single commit. 
* Add comments for your future selves and for your current/future peers
* Do not make whitespace changes as part of your regular/feature commits. 
* If you feel whitespace issues need to be fixed, please push a separate 
  commit for the same. It will be approved quickly without any discussion.
