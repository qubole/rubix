2. Navigate to your account and clone that copy to your development box
git clone https://github.com/<username>/rubix
3. Create a branch and start working on your change.
4. Once you have done all the changes make a local commit and push to your repository. Make sure you run all the unit tests: `mvn clean install`
This will run all the unit test.
5. Create a Pull Request(PR)
6. Contributors from rubix will review and approve or request changes.You may discuss these changes with the reviewer and  make changes in your private branch. Repeat the process between 4-6 until this is accepted by the reviewer.
