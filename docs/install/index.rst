Installation Guide
##################


This section provides instructions to install Rubix and use it with Presto or
Hive. Instructions are tested on an EMR 5.X cluster. Same instructions should work
with installations on-prem and other distributions. Please `contact <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubix-users>`_
the community if you have questions or issues. 

The instructions require `RubiX Admin <https://github.com/qubole/rubix-admin>`_
