0.3.1 (2018-05-22)
-----------------------------

New
~~~
- Clean up README. Open issues to move most of the contents to docs
  (#133) [Rajat Venkatesh]

  Initially README was the only source of documentation. We have recently
  created a doc site on readthedocs.org. Therefore we can now organize the docs
  in a better way there. As a first step, this commit cleans up README and opens
  the following issues:
  #126 #127 #128 #129 #130 #131 #132

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Add strata talk to readme (#136) [Shubham Tagra]
- Remove Hadoop1 module as it is not supported (#135) [Rajat Venkatesh]

  Hadoop1 module was an experimental module to test with Hadoop 1 clusters.
  It is not supported in production with QDS or outside. Remove code as Hadoop1
  is not used anymore.

- #124: report liveness metric for BookKeeper daemon (#139) [Jordan Wilson]

  Add a liveness gauge that the daemon is up & alive. Right now, this is a

  is alive. In the future, this simple framework will be used to add more 
  comprehensive health checks. Ref: #140

- EMR: move client config to independent file (#73) [Vamshi Pasunuru]

  Whatever properties that are needed by rubix client can now be specified

  properties in this file during installation. This avoid the need for an 
  explicit dependency on yarn config.

  Tested in Qubole and EMR clusters.
